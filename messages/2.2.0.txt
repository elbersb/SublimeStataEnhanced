----------------------
Sublime Stata 13 2.2.0
----------------------

Enhancements (thanks to @elbersb)!:
    * Merge the two version-specific commands into one; this get rids of some
      of the required configuration (also fixes #43)
    * Build system now works on Windows as well; should work better on OS X
      (i.e., also for older versions of Stata)
    * Stata is found automatically on OS X; for OS X users, the plugin should
      now work without any configuration at all
